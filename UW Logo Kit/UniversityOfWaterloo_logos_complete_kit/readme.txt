************************************************EPSUse .eps (encapsulated postscript) files for design work in software such as the Adobe Creative Suite, large print projects, distribution to vendors for merchandising (for example, embroidery on a shirt). You can also insert .eps files in MS Office files like Word and PowerPoint. .eps files contain data that programs use to re-render the image and retain the vector data from the native source. This means that they can scale to any size without a reduction in quality.Do not use the .eps files to create your own version of the logo. All approved versions are provided in this download.JPGUse .jpg files for design work in MS Office projects, digital publishing and small in-house print projects (e.g. a luncheon announcement for a bulletin board). .jpg files are compressed/flat lossy versions of the logo. These image files can be made smaller, but cannot be made larger as quality would be significantly reduced.  PNGUse .png files for digital publishing such as PowerPoint presentations, display screens, websites and e-newletters. .png files are bitmapped images with lossless data compression. The .png format replaces the .gif format and has enhanced display and performance properties. All of the .png files have a transparent background. .png  files can be made smaller, but cannot be made larger as quality would be significantly reduced.  ************************************************File name key
