      <description>Laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions form an ideal standard for the simulation of interacting quantum spin models. Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields.</description>

      <description>Trapped ions have emerged as one of the highest quality platforms for the quantum simulation of interacting spin models of interest to various fields of physics. In such simulators, two effective spins can be made to interact with arbitrary strengths by coupling to the collective vibrational or phonon states of ions, controlled by precisely tuned laser beams.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Hamiltonian engineering of 2D rectangular lattices in a one-dimensional ion chain</title>

      <description>Controlling the interaction graph between spins or qubits in a quantum simulator allows user-controlled tailoring of native interactions to achieve a target Hamiltonian. The flexibility of engineering long-ranged phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator offers such a possibility. Trapped ions, a leading candidate for simulating computationally hard quantum many-body dynamics, are most readily trapped in a linear 1D chain, limiting their utility for readily simulating higher dimensional spin models.</description>

      <description>Quantization of energy is a quintessential characteristic of quantum systems. Here we analyze its effects on the operation of Otto cycle heat machines and show that energy quantization alone may alter and increase machine performance in terms of output power, efficiency, and even operation mode. Our results demonstrate that quantum thermodynamics enable the realization of classically inconceivable Otto machines, such as those with an incompressible working fluid.</description>

      <description>A trapped ion transported along a periodic potential is studied as a paradigmatic nanocontact frictional interface. The combination of the periodic corrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a one-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to multistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities.</description>
