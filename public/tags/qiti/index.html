      <p>Laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions form an ideal standard for the
simulation of interacting quantum spin models. Effective spins are represented
by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be
measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence
techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the
ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to
long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by
shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields. Here we review the
theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the
experimental preparation of complex equilibrium states, and the study of
dynamical processes of this many-body interacting quantum system. The use of
such quantum simulators for studying spin models may inform our understanding
of exotic quantum materials and shed light on interacting quantum systems that
cannot be modeled with conventional computers.</p>

      <p>Trapped ions have emerged as one of the highest quality platforms for the
quantum simulation of interacting spin models of interest to various fields of
physics. In such simulators, two effective spins can be made to interact with
arbitrary strengths by coupling to the collective vibrational or phonon states
of ions, controlled by precisely tuned laser beams. However, the task of
determining laser control parameters required for a given spin-spin interaction
graph is a type of inverse problem, which can be highly mathematically complex.
In this paper, we adapt a modern machine learning technique developed for
similar inverse problems to the task of finding the laser control parameters
for a number of interaction graphs. We demonstrate that typical graphs, forming
regular lattices of interest to physicists, can easily be produced for up to 50
ions using a single GPU workstation. The scaling of the machine learning method
suggests that this can be expanded to hundreds of ions with moderate additional
computational effort.</p>

      <p>Controlling the interaction graph between spins or qubits in a quantum
simulator allows user-controlled tailoring of native interactions to achieve a
target Hamiltonian. The flexibility of engineering long-ranged phonon-mediated
spin-spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator offers such a
possibility. Trapped ions, a leading candidate for simulating computationally
hard quantum many-body dynamics, are most readily trapped in a linear 1D chain,
limiting their utility for readily simulating higher dimensional spin models.
In this work, we introduce a hybrid method of analog-digital simulation for
simulating 2D spin models and dynamically changing interactions to achieve a
new graph using a linear 1D chain. The method relies on time domain Hamiltonian
engineering through a successive application of Stark shift gradient pulses,
and wherein the pulse sequence can simply be obtained from a Fourier series
decomposition of the target Hamiltonian over the space of lattice couplings. We
focus on engineering 2D rectangular nearest-neighbor spin lattices,
demonstrating that the required control parameters scale linearly with ion
number. This hybrid approach offers compelling possibilities for the use of 1D
chains in the study of Hamiltonian quenches, dynamical phase transitions, and
quantum transport in 2D and 3D. We discuss a possible experimental
implementation of this approach using real experimental parameters.</p>

      <p>Quantization of energy is a quintessential characteristic of quantum systems.
Here we analyze its effects on the operation of Otto cycle heat machines and
show that energy quantization alone may alter and increase machine performance
in terms of output power, efficiency, and even operation mode. Our results
demonstrate that quantum thermodynamics enable the realization of classically
inconceivable Otto machines, such as those with an incompressible working
fluid. We propose to measure these effects experimentally using a laser-cooled
trapped ion as a microscopic heat machine.</p>

      <p>A trapped ion transported along a periodic potential is studied as a
paradigmatic nanocontact frictional interface. The combination of the periodic
corrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a
one-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to
multistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to
the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities. The
observed probabilities show that the multislip regime can be reached
dynamically at smaller corrugations than would be possible statically, and can
be described by an equilibrium Boltzmann model. While a clear microscopic
signature of multislip behavior is observed for the ion motion, the frictional
force and dissipation are only weakly affected by the transition to multistable
potentials.</p>
