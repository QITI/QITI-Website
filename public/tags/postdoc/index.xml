      <description>Roland joined the QITI group in 2018 to work on the design, construction and characterization of a quantum simulator of spin-lattice geometries based on trapped atomic ions. His research focuses on taking advantage of the shared motional structure of the trapped ions and the flexibility of holographic imaging to program interactions between any pair of spins.</description>

      <description>Fereshteh is a postdoctoral fellow, working on theoretical aspects of trapped-ion physics. She shares her time with astrophysicists at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. As a postdoc in the QITI group, Fereshteh developed hybrid digital-analog quantum simulation protocols, and is currently theoretically investigating optical trapping schemes for ions.</description>
