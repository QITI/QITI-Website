      <description>Dr. Manas Sajjan defends his MSc thesis online! His MSc work included both theoretical and experimental aspects. On the theoretical side, Manas investigated the role of optical tweezer potentials on ions confined in a radio-frequency (RF) trap. Optical tweezers would allow for local control of the confining potential, which can be used for investigating quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>“Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator” is published in Quantum Science and Technology 5 (2020) 024001, (arXiv.1910.02496). We numerically demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently solve a non-linear inversion problem in an analog trapped-ion quantum simulator. The method generates experimental control parameters (such as laser intensities on each ions) needed to program a quantum simulator, in particular, to engineer an arbitrary spin lattice geometry in one, two, and three dimensions using a linear chain of ions!</description>

      <description>Here’s a picture of eight laser-cooled Ytterbium (174 isotope) ions in a linear chain! The image was taken using an off-the-shelf Thorlabs 0.1 NA objective and a cheap (~$300) CMOS camera. The ions are approximately 8 microns apart.
