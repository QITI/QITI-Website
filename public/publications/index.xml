      <description>Laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions form an ideal standard for the simulation of interacting quantum spin models. Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields.</description>

      <description>Trapped ions have emerged as one of the highest quality platforms for the quantum simulation of interacting spin models of interest to various fields of physics. In such simulators, two effective spins can be made to interact with arbitrary strengths by coupling to the collective vibrational or phonon states of ions, controlled by precisely tuned laser beams. However, the task of determining laser control parameters required for a given spin-spin interaction graph is a type of inverse problem, which can be highly mathematically complex.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Hamiltonian engineering of 2D rectangular lattices in a one-dimensional ion chain</title>

      <description>Controlling the interaction graph between spins or qubits in a quantum simulator allows user-controlled tailoring of native interactions to achieve a target Hamiltonian. The flexibility of engineering long-ranged phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator offers such a possibility. Trapped ions, a leading candidate for simulating computationally hard quantum many-body dynamics, are most readily trapped in a linear 1D chain, limiting their utility for readily simulating higher dimensional spin models.</description>

      <description>Quantization of energy is a quintessential characteristic of quantum systems. Here we analyze its effects on the operation of Otto cycle heat machines and show that energy quantization alone may alter and increase machine performance in terms of output power, efficiency, and even operation mode. Our results demonstrate that quantum thermodynamics enable the realization of classically inconceivable Otto machines, such as those with an incompressible working fluid. We propose to measure these effects experimentally using a laser-cooled trapped ion as a microscopic heat machine.</description>

      <description>A trapped ion transported along a periodic potential is studied as a paradigmatic nanocontact frictional interface. The combination of the periodic corrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a one-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to multistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities. The observed probabilities show that the multislip regime can be reached dynamically at smaller corrugations than would be possible statically, and can be described by an equilibrium Boltzmann model.</description>

      <description>High-resolution addressing of individual ultracold atoms, trapped ions or solid state emitters allows for exquisite control in quantum optics experiments. This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics that project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance. We use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror device to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and amplitude control. The system self-corrects for aberrations of up to several $\lambda$ and reduces them to $\lambda/50$, leading to light patterns with a precision on the $10^{-4}$ level.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement entropy in a quantum many-body system</title>

      <description>Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is rapidly gaining prominence in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. Despite this generality, measuring entanglement remains challenging. This is especially true in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated quantum walks in optical lattices</title>

      <description>Full control over the dynamics of interacting, indistinguishable quantum particles is an important prerequisite for the experimental study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the implementation of high-fidelity quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate such control over the quantum walk - the quantum mechanical analogue of the classical random walk - in the strong interaction regime. Using interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we directly observe fundamental effects such as the emergence of correlations in two-particle quantum walks, as well as strongly correlated Bloch oscillations in tilted optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Beat note stabilization of mode-locked lasers for quantum information processing</title>

      <description>We stabilize a chosen radiofrequency beat note between two optical fields derived from the same mode-locked laser pulse train, in order to coherently manipulate quantum information. This scheme does not require access or active stabilization of the laser repetition rate. We implement and characterize this external lock, in the context of two-photon stimulated Raman transitions between the hyperfine ground states of trapped 171-Yb+ quantum bits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Catalysis of Magnetic Phase Transitions in a Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>We control quantum fluctuations to create the ground state magnetic phases of a classical Ising model with a tunable longitudinal magnetic field using a system of 6 to 10 atomic ion spins. Due to the long-range Ising interactions, the various ground state spin configurations are separated by multiple first-order phase transitions, which in our zero temperature system cannot be driven by thermal fluctuations. We instead use a transverse magnetic field as a quantum catalyst to observe the first steps of the complete fractal devil&amp;rsquo;s staircase, which emerges in the thermodynamic limit and can be mapped to a large number of many-body and energy-optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Emergence and Frustration of Magnetism with Variable-Range Interactions in a Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the complexity of many body systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. In quantum magnetic systems, frustration arises naturally from competing spin-spin interactions given by the geometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic couplings. Frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses and spin ices, whose ground states are massively degenerate and can carry high degrees of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>A quantum simulator is a well controlled quantum system that can simulate the behavior of another quantum system which may require exponentially large classical computing resources to understand otherwise. In the 1980s, Feynman proposed the use of quantum logic gates on a standard controllable quantum system to efficiently simulate the behavior of a model Hamiltonian. Recent experiments using trapped ions and neutral atoms have realized quantum simulation of Ising model in presence of external magnetic fields, and showed almost arbitrary control in generating non-trivial Ising coupling patterns.</description>

      <description>We demonstrate tunable spin-spin couplings between trapped atomic ions, mediated by laser forces on multiple transverse collective modes of motion. A $\sigma_x \sigma_x$-type Ising interaction is realized between quantum bits stored in the ground hyperfine clock states of Yb ions. We demonstrate entangling gates and tailor the spin-spin couplings with two and three trapped ions. The use of closely-spaced transverse modes provides a new class of interactions relevant to quantum computing and simulation with large collections of ions in a single crystal.</description>

      <description>We propose a large-scale quantum computer architecture by stabilizing a single large linear ion chain in a very simple trap geometry. By confining ions in an anharmonic linear trap with nearly uniform spacing between ions, we show that high-fidelity quantum gates can be realized in large linear ion crystals under the Doppler temperature based on coupling to a near-continuum of transverse motional modes with simple shaped laser pulses.</description>
