      <description>Scott joined the group for the Summer of 2020 through the IQC Undergraduate Research Award. His projects include simulating photon counts from trapped ion qubits onto multiple detectors to correlate measurements and increase detection fidelity, as well as designing an imaging system which minimizes aberration. He graduated from the University of Alberta in 2020 with a major in Engineering Physics (co-op program) and a minor in Linguistics.</description>
