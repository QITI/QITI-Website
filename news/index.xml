His MSc work included both theoretical and experimental aspects. On the theoretical side, Manas investigated the role of optical tweezer potentials on ions confined in a radio-frequency (RF) trap. Optical tweezers would allow for local control of the confining potential, which can be used for investigating quantum thermodynamics. On the experimental side, Manas was part of the team that built our four-rod trap. He fabricated the electrodes, built the RF resonator which powers them, and worked on optics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>16 July 2020 - Building a quantum simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20200716_iqc_feature_video/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 22:24:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20200716_iqc_feature_video/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a feature of our lab by IQC.
