Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales.</description></item><item><title>3 Sep 2025 - Welcome to the new graduate students: Mu, Faizan, and Chris!</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20250903_welcome_mu_faizan_chris/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20250903_welcome_mu_faizan_chris/</guid><description>New ion trappers have joined the QITI Lab!

To harness the full potential of the trapped ion system, it is imperative to employ an efficient ion loading scheme. While the conventional oven loading method has its drawbacks, such as slow loading time, resource wastage, and potential contamination that can compromise system longevity and introduce decoherence, the pulsed laser ablation loading offers a promising alternative.</description></item><item><title>Programmable Individual Addressing and Floquet Hamiltonian Dynamics in a Trapped Ion Quantum Processor</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</guid><description>Trapped ions have been gaining traction as a platform for quantum information processing (QIP) in both academia and industry over the last decade.

The XY model with long-range interactions can be implemented with a single side-band Mølmer-Sørensen scheme, giving interactions that decay as 1/r^α , where α parameterises the interaction range. Lower α leads to longer range interactions, allowing faster long-range gate operations for quantum computing.</description></item><item><title>Leo Xing</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/leo-xing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/leo-xing/</guid><description>Leo was an undergraduate mechantronics Co-op student who worked as a mechanical designer in Dr. Islam&amp;rsquo;s group after his Mechatronics Eng. 2A term.

In this manuscript, we theoretically and numerically investigate a hybrid trapping architecture by incorporating optical tweezers (laser beams tightly focused on individual ions) in a conventional trap. The local control over the potential would offer many capabilities - such as engineering a target set of phonon modes, fixing the motional de-coupling problem in a multi-species ion system, and allowing novel experiments in quantum thermodynamics.</description></item><item><title>06 Aug 2021 - Gilbert receives IQC Achievement Award!</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20210806_gilbert_iqc_achievement_award/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20210806_gilbert_iqc_achievement_award/</guid><description>Congratulations to Chung-You (Gilbert) Shih , a PhD student in the group for receiving the IQC Achievement Award, 2021!

We numerically demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently solve a non-linear inversion problem in an analog trapped-ion quantum simulator. The method generates experimental control parameters (such as laser intensities on each ions) needed to program a quantum simulator, in particular, to engineer an arbitrary spin lattice geometry in one, two, and three dimensions using a linear chain of ions!</description></item><item><title>Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-machine-learning-design-of-a-trapped-ion-quantum-spin-simulator/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-machine-learning-design-of-a-trapped-ion-quantum-spin-simulator/</guid><description>Trapped ion quantum simulators can in principle simulate an arbitrarily connected spin model.

To individually address ions at a single-ion level, it requires sophisticated optical engineering. In the thesis, we present a novel single qubit addressing system that is immune to imperfections of optical imaging and can scale to different size of the system.</description></item><item><title>Design and Construction of an Ion Trapping Apparatus for Quantum Simulation Experiments</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</guid><description>The trapped ions platform represents an excellent framework for Quantum information science experiments.

The combination of the periodic corrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a one-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to multistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities.</description></item><item><title>28 Jun 2017 - first (temporary) home of the QITI lab!</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20170628_temp_home_qiti_lab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2017 22:23:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news/20170628_temp_home_qiti_lab/</guid><description>We move into a temporary laboratory space on the third floor of the Quantum Nano Center!

This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics that project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance. We use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror device to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and amplitude control.</description></item><item><title>Measuring entanglement entropy in a quantum many-body system</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2015-measuring-entanglement-entropy-in-a-quantum-many-body-system/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2015-measuring-entanglement-entropy-in-a-quantum-many-body-system/</guid><description>Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is rapidly gaining prominence in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. Despite this generality, measuring entanglement remains challenging. This is especially true in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive.</description></item><item><title>Strongly correlated quantum walks in optical lattices</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2015-strongly-correlated-quantum-walks-in-optical-lattices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2015-strongly-correlated-quantum-walks-in-optical-lattices/</guid><description>Full control over the dynamics of interacting, indistinguishable quantum particles is an important prerequisite for the experimental study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the implementation of high-fidelity quantum information processing.

Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields.</description></item><item><title>Entanglement and Tunable Spin-Spin Couplings between Trapped Ions Using Multiple Transverse Modes</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</guid><description>We demonstrate tunable spin-spin couplings between trapped atomic ions, mediated by laser forces on multiple transverse collective modes of motion.
