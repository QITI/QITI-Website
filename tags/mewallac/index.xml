Returning after my 3B Mechanical Engineering school term was one of the easiest choices of my University career! I am looking forward to working on the optics further with more hands on experience and seeing the things designed in terms past come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love digital art and creation as well as film and photography. Material science, coding and mechanical design have been highlights from my coursework and I look forward to applying my existing knowledge while learning as much as possible!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
