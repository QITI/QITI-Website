Specific scientific interests include the interplay of coherent dynamics and dissipation, cooling and thermal behavior of many-body quantum systems, and Hamiltonian verification protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony enjoys travelling and cooking. His special skills include hand origame, optics table yoga, and having the second longest arms in the lab. Go Bears!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
