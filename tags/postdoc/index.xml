Previously, he did his MSc thesis from the same group, focusing on analog-digital hybrid quantum simulation protocols.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Roland Habl√ºtzel</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/roland-habl%C3%BCtzel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 20:42:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/roland-habl%C3%BCtzel/</guid><description>Roland joined the QITI group in 2018 to work on the design, construction and characterization of a quantum simulator of spin-lattice geometries based on trapped atomic ions. His research focuses on taking advantage of the shared motional structure of the trapped ions and the flexibility of holographic imaging to program interactions between any pair of spins.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Fereshteh Rajabi</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/fereshteh-rajabi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 23:59:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/fereshteh-rajabi/</guid><description>Fereshteh was a postdoctoral fellow, working on theoretical aspects of trapped-ion physics. She developed hybrid digital-analog quantum simulation protocols, and investigated optical trapping schemes for ions.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Akbar Jahangiri Jozani</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/akbar-jahangiri-jozani/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/akbar-jahangiri-jozani/</guid><description>Dr. Akbar Jahangiri works as a Post Doc. for the Quantum ion project.</description></item><item><title>Dr. Matthew Day</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/matthew-day/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 20:42:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/members/matthew-day/</guid><description>Since 2019, Matt has been working on QuantumION, an open-access trapped ion quantum computer.
