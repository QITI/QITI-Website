I’m generally interested in the manufacturing and properties of metallic materials, as well as mechanical design techniques. In particular, I’m interested in combinations of cutting-edge machining technology and new iterative design methods to manufacture and create novel creations for fashion and industrial design sectors.</description></item></channel></rss>
