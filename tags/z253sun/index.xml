He joined the MSc program at Waterloo in Fall 2019. At Waterloo, Zewen&amp;rsquo;s research interest is in theoretical and numerical investigations on various aspects of light-matter interaction, especially the physics of ions trapped in optical potentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides physics, Zewen is interested in almost any field, so feel free to talk to him, even if you are not sure what to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
