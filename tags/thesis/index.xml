Understanding these systems enable the design and development of everything from materials, pharmaceuticals and even machine learning algorithms. However, to our knowledge, classical simulation of these systems are naturally insufficient and or inefficient.</description></item><item><title>Towards Large Scale Quantum Simulations with Trapped Ions: Programmable XY model, Precise Light Sensing, and Extreme High Vacuum</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-nikhil-kotibhaskar-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-nikhil-kotibhaskar-phd-thesis/</guid><description>We are currently witnessing a revolution in quantum technologies. Today&amp;rsquo;s controllable quantum devices have reached a complexity that makes it practically intractable to fully simulate their dynamics using current classical supercomputers. Decades of fundamental research and development have led us to this point. In the coming years, billions of dollars in investments from governments and private entities are expected worldwide.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of the Optical Infrastructure and Trapping Potential for a Quantum Processor Based on Trapped Barium Ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-xinghe-tan-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-xinghe-tan-msc-thesis/</guid><description>Trapped ion quantum computers represent a cutting-edge quantum computing platform, keeping the highest reported state preparation and measurement fidelity of 99.97%.

To harness the full potential of the trapped ion system, it is imperative to employ an efficient ion loading scheme. While the conventional oven loading method has its drawbacks, such as slow loading time, resource wastage, and potential contamination that can compromise system longevity and introduce decoherence, the pulsed laser ablation loading offers a promising alternative.</description></item><item><title>Programmable Individual Addressing and Floquet Hamiltonian Dynamics in a Trapped Ion Quantum Processor</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</guid><description>Trapped ions have been gaining traction as a platform for quantum information processing (QIP) in both academia and industry over the last decade. Their long coherence time, high fidelity gate operations, and built-in all-to-all connectivity are some of the key features that make trapped ions promising. However, to unlock the full potential of the trapped ion platform, sophisticated quantum controls are required.</description></item><item><title>Developing a Large-Scale, Programmable Trapped Ion Quantum Simulator with In Situ Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sainath-motlakunta-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sainath-motlakunta-phd-thesis/</guid><description>Quantum simulators are a valuable resource for studying complex many-body systems. With their ability to provide near-term advantages, analog quantum simulators show great promise. In this thesis, my aim is to describe the construction of a large-scale trapped-ion based analog quantum simulator with several objectives in mind: controllability, minimal external decoherence, an expandable toolkit for quantum simulations, enhanced stability through robust design practices, and pushing the boundaries of error correction.</description></item><item><title>On the evaluation of quantum instruments with a consideration to measurements in trapped ion systems</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-darian-mclaren-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-darian-mclaren-msc-thesis/</guid><description>Trapped ion chains have shown promise in their application as quantum simulators. However, the close proximity of ions in the trap leads to operations such as state detection causing loss of coherence of other ions due to imperfect beam addressing and absorption of scattered photons during neighbouring ion fluorescence. In the first part of my thesis I consider a Ytterbium 171 ion trap and calculate the probability of neighbouring ion photon absorption.</description></item><item><title>Coherent interactions and thermometry in a trapped ion quantum simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-anthony-vogliano-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-anthony-vogliano-msc-thesis/</guid><description>Quantum simulators are useful tools to study exotic systems which may be otherwise intractable for a traditional computer. In particular, the trapped-ion platform has been a leading candidate for use in quantum simulation experiments because of its high fidelity state-preparation and measurement operations and its all-to-all connectivity. The relative difficulty of interacting with the long lived hyperfine states of 171Yb+ ions make them excellent choices for encoding information as the isolation creates stability against a noisy environment.</description></item><item><title>Robust Optical Engineering for a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-ali-binai-motlagh-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-ali-binai-motlagh-msc-thesis/</guid><description>Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for the implementation of quantum information processing (QIP), exhibiting one of the highest reported quantum gate and measurement fidelities.

Doing so will require advances in the approach for all aspects of current experimental systems. The QuantumION project is a large step in this direction. This project will provide an open-access trapped ion quantum processor for the research community.</description></item><item><title>Experimental and theoretical investigations of radio-frequency and optical trapping potentials for atomic ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-sajjan-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-sajjan-msc-thesis/</guid><description>Over the years, trapped ion have emerged as one of the premier candidates for universal quantum simulation due to its long coherence time, low initialization and detection errors, robust high-fidelity gate sets and fully connected yet tunable spin-graph. In this thesis we exclusively focus on the generation of the trapping potential in a four-rod trap, one of the most commonly studied ion-trapping architecture.</description></item><item><title>Holographic Optical Manipulation of Trapped Ions for Quantum Simulation</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-holographic-optical-manipulation-of-trapped-ions-for-quantum-simulation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-holographic-optical-manipulation-of-trapped-ions-for-quantum-simulation/</guid><description>Trapped ion is one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation experiment due to its long coherence time and high fidelity state initialization, detection, and manipulation. To individually address ions at a single-ion level, it requires sophisticated optical engineering. In the thesis, we present a novel single qubit addressing system that is immune to imperfections of optical imaging and can scale to different size of the system.</description></item><item><title>Design and Construction of an Ion Trapping Apparatus for Quantum Simulation Experiments</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</guid><description>The trapped ions platform represents an excellent framework for Quantum information science experiments.
