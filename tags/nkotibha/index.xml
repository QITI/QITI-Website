Previously, he co-developed a &amp;lsquo;four-rod&amp;rsquo; ion trap for his MSc thesis in the same group. Nikhil holds an undergraduate degree in Mechatronics from Sastra University in India and worked in the ion trapping lab at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
