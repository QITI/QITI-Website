Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales.</description></item><item><title>Preserving a qubit during state-destroying operations on an adjacent qubit at a few micrometers distance</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-motlakunta-preserving-a-qubit-crosstalk-paper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-motlakunta-preserving-a-qubit-crosstalk-paper/</guid><description>Abstract: Protecting qubits from accidental measurements is essential for controlled quantum operations, especially during state-destroying measurements or resets on adjacent qubits, in protocols like quantum error correction. Current methods to preserve atomic qubits against such disturbances waste coherence time, extra qubits, and introduce additional errors. We demonstrate the feasibility of in-situ state-reset and state-measurement of trapped ions, achieving &amp;gt;99.</description></item><item><title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-xy-paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-xy-paper/</guid><description>Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type (Jx XX + Jy YY) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the Jx and Jy terms.

Specifically, barium trapped ions have been shown to have exceptional state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelities. The 133Ba+ (I=1/2) isotope in particular is a promising candidate for large-scale quantum computing experiments.</description></item><item><title>Investigations of 2D ion crystals in a hybrid optical cavity trap for quantum information processing</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sun-2d-ions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sun-2d-ions/</guid><description>Abstract: We numerically investigate a hybrid trapping architecture for 2D ion crystals using static electrode voltages and optical cavity fields for in-plane and out-of-plane confinements, respectively. By studying the stability of 2D crystals against 2D-3D structural phase transitions, we identify the necessary trapping parameters for ytterbium ions. Multiple equilibrium configurations for 2D crystals are possible, and we analyze their stability by estimating potential barriers between them.</description></item><item><title>A guided light system for agile individual addressing of Ba+ qubits with 1E-4 level intensity crosstalk</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-binai-motlagh2023-a-guided-light-system/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-binai-motlagh2023-a-guided-light-system/</guid><description>Abstract: Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing, exhibiting the highest gate and measurement fidelities of all contending hardware. In order to realize a universal quantum computer with trapped ions, independent and parallel control over the state of each qubit is necessary. The manipulation of individual qubit states in an ion chain via stimulated Raman transitions generally requires light focused on individual ions.</description></item><item><title>Ion Trap Long-Range XY Model for Quantum State Transfer and Optimal Spatial Search</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-lewis-bose-ion-trap-long-range-xy-model-for-quantum-state-transfer-and-optimal-spatial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-lewis-bose-ion-trap-long-range-xy-model-for-quantum-state-transfer-and-optimal-spatial/</guid><description>Abstract: Linear ion trap chains are a promising platform for quantum computation and simulation. The XY model with long-range interactions can be implemented with a single side-band Mølmer-Sørensen scheme, giving interactions that decay as 1/r^α , where α parameterises the interaction range. Lower α leads to longer range interactions, allowing faster long-range gate operations for quantum computing.</description></item><item><title>Fast and high-yield fabrication of axially symmetric ion-trap needle electrodes via two step electrochemical etching</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-fast-and-high-yield-fabrication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-fast-and-high-yield-fabrication/</guid><description>Abstract: Despite the progress in building sophisticated microfabricated ion traps, Paul traps employing needle electrodes retain their significance due to the simplicity of fabrication while producing high-quality systems suitable for quantum information processing, atomic clocks etc. For low noise operations such as minimizing ‘excess micromotion’, needles should be geometrically straight and aligned precisely with respect to each other.</description></item><item><title>Limits on atomic qubit control from laser noise</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-day-limits-on-atomic-qubit-control-from-laser-noise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-day-limits-on-atomic-qubit-control-from-laser-noise/</guid><description>This manuscript presents a numerical analysis of the impact of laser noise on qubit operations.
Abstract: Technical noise present in laser systems can limit their ability to perform high fidelity quantum control of atomic qubits. The ultimate fidelity floor for atomic qubits driven with laser radiation is due to spontaneous emission from excited energy levels.</description></item><item><title>Simulating a measurement-induced phase transition for trapped ion circuits</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-czichek-mpt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-czichek-mpt/</guid><description>In this theoretical proposal, we describe a hybrid circuit where coherent time evolution is interrupted by sparse projective measurements. A measurement-driven phase transition between volume-law and area-law entanglement is predicted at a specific rate of measurement. Proof-of-principle experiments can be performed in modern trapped ion quantum information processors.

In this manuscript, we theoretically and numerically investigate a hybrid trapping architecture by incorporating optical tweezers (laser beams tightly focused on individual ions) in a conventional trap. The local control over the potential would offer many capabilities - such as engineering a target set of phonon modes, fixing the motional de-coupling problem in a multi-species ion system, and allowing novel experiments in quantum thermodynamics.</description></item><item><title>Programming the full stack of an open-access quantum computer</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-frey-quala-full-stack-programming-quantumion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-frey-quala-full-stack-programming-quantumion/</guid><description>This manuscript describes the full stack programming of QuantumION, an open-access, remote-controlled, trapped-ion quantum information processor for the research community, currently being developed at Waterloo.

Using the ion as a sensor, we characterize the total optical aberrations in the entire beam path. We then compensate for the aberration by feeding back onto the hologram, such that the residual aberration at the ion is about λ/20, which is smaller than specifications for individual commercial optic.</description></item><item><title>Programmable Quantum Simulations of Spin Systems with Trapped Ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-programmable-quantum-simulations-of-spin-systems-with-trapped-ions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2020-programmable-quantum-simulations-of-spin-systems-with-trapped-ions/</guid><description>This is a comprehensive review article on trapped-ion quantum simulation of spin systems, written jointly with colleagues from Univ. of Maryland, UCLA, Tsinghua Univ., Colorado School of Mines, Middlebury College, Rice Univ., Indiana Univ., Univ. of Waterloo, and UC Berkeley.
