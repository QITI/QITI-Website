Zewen received his BSc degree in physics from Tianjin Normal University and Trent University via a joint program, in 2019. He joined the MSc program at Waterloo in Fall 2019. At Waterloo, Zewen's research interest is in theoretical and numerical investigations on various aspects of light-matter interaction, especially the physics of ions trapped in optical potentials.

Besides physics, Zewen is interested in almost any field, so feel free to talk to him, even if you are not sure what to talk about.
