Fereshteh is a postdoctoral fellow, working on theoretical aspects of trapped-ion physics. She shares her time with astrophysicists at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. As a postdoc in the QITI group, Fereshteh developed hybrid digital-analog quantum simulation protocols, and is currently theoretically investigating optical trapping schemes for ions.
