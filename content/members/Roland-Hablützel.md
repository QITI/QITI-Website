Roland joined the QITI group to work on the design, construction and characterization of a quantum simulator of spin-lattice geometries based on trapped atomic ions. His research focuses on taking advantage of the shared motional structure of the trapped ions and the flexibility of holographic imaging to program interactions between any pair of spins.

He completed his Ph.D. in the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Prof. Dzmitry Matsukevich, where he studied coherent coupling of motional modes in a linear chain of three ions.
