Cyrus is working on his PHYS 437 undergraduate thesis with Prof. Islam on 'Classical Optimization Techniques for a Trapped Ion Quantum Simulator'. To confine the ions in a blade trap, the voltages on the electrodes must first be computed. Cyrus is exploring various optimization and computational techniques to solve this, including machine learning.
