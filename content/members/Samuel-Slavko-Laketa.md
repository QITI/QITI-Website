For his PHYS 437 BSc Physics project, Samuel is numerically investigating laser frequency stabilization for trapped-ion quantum information processing. In particular, his interest is in understanding the stabilization of beat-notes in the context of two-photon Raman transitions with mode-locked lasers.
