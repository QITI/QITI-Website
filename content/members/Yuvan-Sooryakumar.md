I'm an undergraduate student studying Physics. Having previously worked on theoretical planet formation, I've made a wild jump to this research group where I hope to leave a mark! I love video games, walks, deep discussions, reading, music, pets, and food. I also love meeting new people, so don't be afraid to say hi!
