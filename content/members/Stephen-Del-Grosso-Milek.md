Currently employed in my fourth co-op term with QITI on the QuantumION project. I'm generally interested in the manufacturing and properties of metallic materials, as well as mechanical design techniques. In particular, I'm interested in combinations of cutting-edge machining technology and new iterative design methods to rapidly manufacture complex and abstract workpieces made of various metals.
