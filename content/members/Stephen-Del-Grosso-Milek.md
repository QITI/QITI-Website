I'm currently in my fifth co-op term, employed for the second time with QITI and the QuantumION project. I’m generally interested in the manufacturing and properties of metallic materials, as well as mechanical design techniques. In particular, I’m interested in combinations of cutting-edge machining technology and new iterative design methods to manufacture and create novel creations for fashion and industrial design sectors.
