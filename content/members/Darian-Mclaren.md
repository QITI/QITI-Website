I graduated from Brandon University with a BSc in 2019 with a double major in both mathematics and physics. After taking a year off I started my MMath degree in applied mathematics (with a focus on quantum information) in the fall of 2020.

I am jointly supervised by Dr. Joel Wallman, Prof. Rajibul Islam, and Prof. Sivabal Sivaloganathan.
