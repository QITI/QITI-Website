Mahmood joined the QuantumION project, as an open-access trapped ion quantum computing facility for the research community, since March 2021. As an experimental AMO physicist, he did contribution to the field of ultracold neutral atoms, at UQML lab at IQC, by building exotic quantum systems with strongly interacting ultracold quantum matter and light e.g. Rydberg-dressed cavity polaritons. His main research activity at UQML was to employ holographic imaging techniques to individually control and manipulate atoms in optical lattices. In addition, he has made important contributions to the developments of quantum memory for light employing naturally trapped rare-earth ions in crystals.
