Purushottam (Kunal) Varkekar is an undergraduate student enrolled in their final year of Astrophysics. He will be working with Dr. Islam and Dr. Sabooni on a Phys 437 research project. The goal of the project is to utilize deformable optics to correct for aberrations in the light and ultimately reduce cross talk when optically addressing a trapped ion system.
