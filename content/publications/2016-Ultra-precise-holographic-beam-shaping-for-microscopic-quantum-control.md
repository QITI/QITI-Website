High-resolution addressing of individual ultracold atoms, trapped ions or
solid state emitters allows for exquisite control in quantum optics
experiments. This becomes possible through large aperture magnifying optics
that project microscopic light patterns with diffraction limited performance.
We use programmable amplitude holograms generated on a digital micromirror
device to create arbitrary microscopic beam shapes with full phase and
amplitude control. The system self-corrects for aberrations of up to several
$\lambda$ and reduces them to $\lambda/50$, leading to light patterns with a
precision on the $10^{-4}$ level. We demonstrate aberration-compensated beam
shaping in an optical lattice experiment and perform single-site addressing in
a quantum gas microscope for $^{87}$Rb.
