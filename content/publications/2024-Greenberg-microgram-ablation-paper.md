**Abstract:** Trapped ions for quantum information processing has been an area of intense study due to the extraordinarily high
 fidelity operations that have been reported experimentally. Specifically, barium trapped ions have been shown to have
 exceptional state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelities. The 133Ba+ (I=1/2) isotope in particular is a promising candidate
 for large-scale quantum computing experiments. However, a major pitfall with this isotope is that it is radioactive and
 is thus generally used in microgram quantities to satisfy safety regulations. We describe a new method for creating microgram
 barium chloride (BaCl_2) ablation targets for use in trapped ion experiments and compare our procedure to previous methods. We outline
 two recipes for fabrication of ablation targets that increase the production of neutral atoms for isotope-selective loading of barium ions.
 We show that heat-treatment of the ablation targets greatly increases the consistency at which neutral atoms can be produced
 and we characterize the uniformity of these targets using trap-independent techniques such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
 and neutral fluorescence collection. Our comparison between fabrication techniques and demonstration of consistent neutral fluorescence
 paves a path towards reliable loading of 133Ba+ in surface traps and opens opportunities for scalable quantum computing with this isotope.
