**Abstract:** We numerically investigate a hybrid trapping architecture for 2D ion crystals using static electrode voltages and
 optical cavity fields for in-plane and out-of-plane confinements, respectively. By studying the stability of 2D crystals against
 2D-3D structural phase transitions, we identify the necessary trapping parameters for ytterbium ions. Multiple equilibrium 
 configurations for 2D crystals are possible, and we analyze their stability by estimating potential barriers between them. 
 We find that scattering to anti-trapping states limits the trapping lifetime, which is consistent with recent experiments employing
 other optical trapping architectures. These 2D ion crystals offer an excellent platform for quantum simulation of frustrated spin systems,
 benefiting from their 2D triangular lattice structure and phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions. Quantum information processing with tens
 of ions is feasible in this scheme with current technologies.
