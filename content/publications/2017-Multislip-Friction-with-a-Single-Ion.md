A trapped ion transported along a periodic potential is studied as a
paradigmatic nanocontact frictional interface. The combination of the periodic
corrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a
one-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to
multistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to
the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities. The
observed probabilities show that the multislip regime can be reached
dynamically at smaller corrugations than would be possible statically, and can
be described by an equilibrium Boltzmann model. While a clear microscopic
signature of multislip behavior is observed for the ion motion, the frictional
force and dissipation are only weakly affected by the transition to multistable
potentials.
