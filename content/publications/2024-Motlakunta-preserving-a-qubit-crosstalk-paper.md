**Abstract:** Protecting qubits from accidental measurements is essential 
for controlled quantum operations, especially during state-destroying measurements 
or resets on adjacent qubits, in protocols like quantum error correction. 
Current methods to preserve atomic qubits against such disturbances waste coherence time, 
extra qubits, and introduce additional errors. We demonstrate the feasibility of in-situ state-reset 
and state-measurement of trapped ions, achieving  >99.9% fidelity in preserving an ‘asset’ ion-qubit 
while a neighboring ‘process’ qubit is reset, and  >99.6% preservation fidelity while applying a 
detection beam for 11 μs on the same neighbor at a distance of 6 μm. This is achieved through precise 
wavefront control of addressing optical beams and using a single ion as both a quantum sensor for 
optical aberrations and an intensity probe with  >50 dB dynamic range. Our demonstrations advance 
quantum processors, enhancing speed and capabilities for tasks like quantum simulations of 
dissipation and measurement-driven phases, and implementing error correction.
