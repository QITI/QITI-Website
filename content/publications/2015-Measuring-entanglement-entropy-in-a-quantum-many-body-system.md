Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It
describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart
of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is rapidly gaining prominence in
diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. Despite this
generality, measuring entanglement remains challenging. This is especially true
in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct
experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we
measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum
interference of many-body twins. Leveraging our single-site resolved control of
ultra-cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare and interfere two
identical copies of a many-body state. This enables us to directly measure
quantum purity, Renyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These
experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases
and dynamics of strongly-correlated many-body systems.
