Trapped ion system is a promising platform for quantum computing, with long qubit coherence, high gate and measurement fidelities. To harness the full potential of the trapped ion system, it is imperative to employ an efficient ion loading scheme. While the conventional oven loading method has its drawbacks, such as slow loading time, resource wastage, and potential contamination that can compromise system longevity and introduce decoherence, the pulsed laser ablation loading offers a promising alternative. This method enables fast, resource efficient, and controllable generation of a neutral atomic flux. This thesis explores the development of a 1.57 Î¼m pulsed laser ablation (PLA) loading scheme for an Ytterbium ion trap. With endeavors in theoretical simulations and experimental setups designed with a keen emphasis on laser-induced damage thresholds, we successfully generated a neutral flux from the ablation laser, acquired a comprehensive isotope spectrum, and estimated the velocity distribution in the atomic plume. A fiber-coupled ablation delivery module was also designed and proved feasible along with the main ablation experiments. This study establishes a solid groundwork for the future integration of pulsed laser ablation loading into our trap system and provides invaluable empirical insights into the use of high-power infrared (IR) pulsed lasers.
