**Abstract:** We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type (Jx XX + Jy YY) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the Jx and Jy terms. The Ising-type interactions ﾏナxﾏニx and ﾏナyﾏニy are simultaneously generated by employing two spin-dependent forces operating in parallel on the same set of normal modes. We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with 171Yb+ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.
