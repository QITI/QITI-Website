**Abstract:** Holographic beam shaping using spatial light modulators (SLMs) as a reprogrammable hologram
offers a powerful tool for precise and flexible optical controls. It has been adopted for a wide
range of researches, including atom trapping, optical addressing
of individual quantum objects, preparation of exotic quantum states, and multi-beam laser machining.
pySLM2 is a python package designed for holographic beam shaping applications, encompassing
hologram generation, simulation, and hardware controls.
