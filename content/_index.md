Welcome to the Laboratory for Quantum Information with Trapped Ions (QITI) of Prof. K. Rajibul Islam! We are a predominantly experimental research group at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and the Department of [Physics and Astronomy](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/) at University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Laser-cooled trapped ions are among the most pristine and controllable quantum systems. The QITI laboratory is building a programmable trapped ion quantum simulator with Ytterbium ions, with control at the level of individual atoms for studying problems in quantum many-body physics and computation.
