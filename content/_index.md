Welcome to the Laboratory for Quantum Information with Trapped Ions (QITI) of Prof. K. Rajibul Islam! We are a predominantly experimental research group at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and the Department of [Physics and Astronomy](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/) at University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Laser-cooled trapped ions are among the most pristine and controllable quantum systems. Our research focuses on various aspects of trapped ion quantum information processing - in particular quantum simulation and quantum computation. We are developing a quantum simulator that can be arbitrarily programmable for simulating interacting quantum spin models relevant for problems in condensed matter physics, high energy physics, and quantum chemistry. Together with Prof. Crystal Senko's research group at IQC, we are developing an open-access, shared trapped-ion quantum computing facility (QuantumIon).

We acknowledge financial support from University of Waterloo, NSERC, Government of Ontario, US ARO, and Transformative Quantum Technologies (TQT, CFREF).
