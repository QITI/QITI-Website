Welcome to the Laboratory for Quantum Information with Trapped Ions (QITI) of Prof. K. Rajibul Islam! We are a predominantly experimental research group at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and the Department of [Physics and Astronomy](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/) at University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Laser-cooled trapped ions are among the most pristine and controllable quantum systems. Research performed in Prof. Islam’s group is currently focused on the following:

- **Quantum simulation:** The QITI laboratory is building a programmable trapped ion quantum simulator with 171Yb+ qubits, with controls at the level of individual atoms for studying problems in quantum many-body physics and computation.
- **QuantumION:** Together with Prof. Crystal Senko’s group, we are building an open-access, remotely operable trapped ion quantum computer (*QuantumION*). The hardware is based on 133Ba+ qubits in a Sandia HOA trap, with individual laser addressing to be able to perform arbitrary single and two-qubit quantum gates. The target commissioning of the machine is Fall 2021, with sixteen qubits. QuantumION is supported by [Transformative Quantum Technologies (TQT)](https://tqt.uwaterloo.ca/).
- **Quantum simulation algorithms:** We research on classical and quantum algorithms to make quantum simulation more efficient, e.g. by using modern machine learning methods. We collaborate with the [Perimeter Institute Quantum Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/research-initiatives/perimeter-institute-quantum-intelligence-lab-piquil).

We acknowledge financial support from University of Waterloo, NSERC, Government of Ontario, US ARO, and Transformative Quantum Technologies (TQT, CFREF).
