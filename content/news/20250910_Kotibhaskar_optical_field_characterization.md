Our paper on characterizing optical fields using ions is [now available](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07214) on the Arxiv! This is an experimental work from the QSim project that shows how ions can not only be used as a platform for quantum information processing, but also to calibrate beams in high-NA systems.
