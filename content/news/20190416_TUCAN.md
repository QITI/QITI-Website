Two talks from the QITI group by Chung-You (Gilbert) Shih and Yi Hong Teoh were presented at the second Toronto Ultra-cold Atom Network (<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/events/toronto-ultracold-atom-network-tucan-meeting-2019" target="_blank">TUCAN</a>) meeting hosted by University of Waterloo. Gilbert talked about efficient algorithms to generate amplitude holograms for optical manipulation, and Yi Hong discussed machine learning methods to program a quantum simulator.
