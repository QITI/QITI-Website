Our manuscript “Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator” is on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02496" target="_blank"> arXiv.1910.02496</a>. We demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently engineer an arbitrary spin-spin interaction graph on an analog quantum simulator.
