“Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator” is published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ab657a" target="_blank">Quantum Science and Technology 5 (2020) 024001</a>, (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02496" target="_blank"> arXiv.1910.02496</a>). We numerically demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently solve a non-linear inversion problem in an analog trapped-ion quantum simulator. The method generates experimental control parameters (such as laser intensities on each ions) needed to program a quantum simulator, in particular, to engineer an arbitrary spin lattice geometry in one, two, and three dimensions using a linear chain of ions!
