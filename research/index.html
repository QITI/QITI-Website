The long range Coulomb interaction between the ions would be exploited to engineer versatile spin Hamiltonians. The spin interactions can be tuned, in principle arbitrarily, and the individual spins can be detected with near perfection. Interacting Hamiltonians and open quantum systems are often hard to simulate on classical computers, and may become intractable beyond 30-40 spins. The QITI laboratory aims to work in the regime where classical computation is difficult or intractable.</p><p>See the publication below:</publist></p></article><p><a id=QuantumION></a></p><hr style=height:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;border-width:0;background-color:#6e626e><article style=background-color:#5a4b5a;width:100% class="post ph3 pv2 white"><h3>QuantumION - an open-access quantum computer for the research community</h3><p>Together with Prof. Crystal Senko’s group, we are building an open-access, remotely operable trapped ion quantum computer (QuantumION).
