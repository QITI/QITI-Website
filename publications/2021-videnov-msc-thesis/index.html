Considering all these imperfections a set of laser parameters are presented for both quenched resolved sideband cooling and electromagnetically induced transparency cooling that in concert will cool all motional modes to the ground state. A novel individual addressing (IA) scheme is presented with detailed simulation showing 10⁻⁵ intensity cross talk and the first attempt at realizing this IA scheme is presented. The design philosophy for opto-mechanical assemblies in QuantumION is discussed and an example assembly is walked through the design process.</p></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="absolute bottom-0 h3 w-100 dn dib-ns" style=background-color:#3f3738 role=contentinfo><hr style=height:2px;display:block;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;border-style:inset;border-width:0;background-color:#514848><div class="flex justify-between pv3 mt1 ph3"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline" style=color:#ded9d9 href=https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/>&copy; QUANTUM INFORMATION WITH TRAPPED IONS 2025</a><div></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
