However, the close proximity of ions in the trap leads to operations such as state detection
causing loss of coherence of other ions due to imperfect beam addressing and absorption
of scattered photons during neighbouring ion fluorescence. In the first part of my thesis I
consider a Ytterbium 171 ion trap and calculate the probability of neighbouring ion photon
absorption. I additionally show how to use the Lindblad master equation to simulate the
dynamics of an ion under an attenuated beam, and provide a review of determining the
detection fidelity through histograms of photon detection counts.
I then return to the more abstract setting of non-destructive quantum measurements,
which are instrumental for fault-tolerant quantum computers. These non-destructive quantum measurements have both a quantum and classical output and hence must be described
through a quantum instrument as opposed to the typical representation of measurements
through POVMâ€™s. It therefore becomes necessary to develop methods for evaluating quantum instruments. In this thesis I show that the process fidelity and diamond distance as
figures of merits on unitary channels may be generalized to figures of merits on quantum
instruments. I show that these figures of merit adequately capture the errors associated to
non-destructive measurements, and they additionally provide upper and lower bounds for
each other. Several examples are also given of computing the figures of merit on quantum
instruments under various noise models.</p></p></div></div></article></div></main><footer class="absolute bottom-0 h3 w-100 dn dib-ns" style=background-color:#3f3738 role=contentinfo><hr style=height:2px;display:block;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;border-style:inset;border-width:0;background-color:#514848><div class="flex justify-between pv3 mt1 ph3"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline" style=color:#ded9d9 href=https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/>&copy; QUANTUM INFORMATION WITH TRAPPED IONS 2025</a><div></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script></body></html>
