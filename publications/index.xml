This scheme does not require access or active stabilization of the laser repetition rate. We implement and characterize this external lock, in the context of two-photon stimulated Raman transitions between the hyperfine ground states of trapped 171-Yb+ quantum bits.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Catalysis of Magnetic Phase Transitions in a Quantum Simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2013-quantum-catalysis-of-magnetic-phase-transitions-in-a-quantum-simulator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2013-quantum-catalysis-of-magnetic-phase-transitions-in-a-quantum-simulator/</guid><description>We control quantum fluctuations to create the ground state magnetic phases of a classical Ising model with a tunable longitudinal magnetic field using a system of 6 to 10 atomic ion spins. Due to the long-range Ising interactions, the various ground state spin configurations are separated by multiple first-order phase transitions, which in our zero temperature system cannot be driven by thermal fluctuations.</description></item><item><title>Emergence and Frustration of Magnetism with Variable-Range Interactions in a Quantum Simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2013-emergence-and-frustration-of-magnetic-order-with-variable-range-interactions-in-a-trapped-ion-quantum-simulator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2013-emergence-and-frustration-of-magnetic-order-with-variable-range-interactions-in-a-trapped-ion-quantum-simulator/</guid><description>Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the complexity of many body systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. In quantum magnetic systems, frustration arises naturally from competing spin-spin interactions given by the geometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic couplings.</description></item><item><title>Quantum simulation of spin models on an arbitrary lattice with trapped ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-korenblit-quantum-simulation-of-spin-models-on-an-arbitrary-lattice-with-trapped-ions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-korenblit-quantum-simulation-of-spin-models-on-an-arbitrary-lattice-with-trapped-ions/</guid><description>A collection of trapped atomic ions represents one of the most attractive platforms for the quantum simulation of interacting spin networks and quantum magnetism.

Effective spins are represented by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields.</description></item><item><title>Entanglement and Tunable Spin-Spin Couplings between Trapped Ions Using Multiple Transverse Modes</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</guid><description>We demonstrate tunable spin-spin couplings between trapped atomic ions, mediated by laser forces on multiple transverse collective modes of motion.

By confining ions in an anharmonic linear trap with nearly uniform spacing between ions, we show that high-fidelity quantum gates can be realized in large linear ion crystals under the Doppler temperature based on coupling to a near-continuum of transverse motional modes with simple shaped laser pulses.</description></item></channel></rss>
