Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Autoregressive Generative Models for Many-body Physics</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2025-yihong-teoh-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2025-yihong-teoh-phd-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Many body physics, the study of emergent behavior from the microscopic interactions between countless degrees of freedom, is fundamental to our understanding of the universe.

Today&amp;rsquo;s controllable quantum devices have reached a complexity that makes it practically intractable to fully simulate their dynamics using current classical supercomputers.
Decades of fundamental research and development have led us to this point. In the coming years, billions of dollars in investments from governments and private entities are expected worldwide. Although general-purpose fault-tolerant quantum computers are expected to impact computing profoundly, today&amp;rsquo;s quantum devices are best suited for their analog quantum operation, where a well-controlled quantum simulator mimics the dynamics of the other quantum system being studied. This affords an advantage over classical simulators at the cost of a restricted set of physical phenomena that can be studied. Today&amp;rsquo;s quantum devices are already providing insights into large-scale entanglement, the underlying physics of high-temperature superconductivity, disordered quantum systems, and much more. Enhancing the capabilities of today&amp;rsquo;s analog quantum simulators requires adding more classes of interactions, reducing errors due to calibration and noise, and increasing the system size to allow larger-scale simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Preserving a qubit during state-destroying operations on an adjacent qubit at a few micrometers distance</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-motlakunta-preserving-a-qubit-crosstalk-paper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-motlakunta-preserving-a-qubit-crosstalk-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Protecting qubits from accidental measurements is essential
for controlled quantum operations, especially during state-destroying measurements
or resets on adjacent qubits, in protocols like quantum error correction.
Current methods to preserve atomic qubits against such disturbances waste coherence time,
extra qubits, and introduce additional errors. We demonstrate the feasibility of in-situ state-reset
and state-measurement of trapped ions, achieving &amp;gt;99.9% fidelity in preserving an ‘asset’ ion-qubit
while a neighboring ‘process’ qubit is reset, and &amp;gt;99.6% preservation fidelity while applying a
detection beam for 11 μs on the same neighbor at a distance of 6 μm. This is achieved through precise
wavefront control of addressing optical beams and using a single ion as both a quantum sensor for
optical aberrations and an intensity probe with &amp;gt;50 dB dynamic range. Our demonstrations advance
quantum processors, enhancing speed and capabilities for tasks like quantum simulations of
dissipation and measurement-driven phases, and implementing error correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programmable XY-type couplings through parallel spin-dependent forces on the same trapped ion motional modes</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-xy-paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-kotibhaskar-xy-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; We propose and experimentally demonstrate an analog scheme for generating XY-type (Jx XX + Jy YY) Hamiltonians on trapped ion spins with independent control over the Jx and Jy terms.

We analytically calculate the region of validity of this scheme, and provide numerical and experimental validation with 171Yb+ ions. This scheme inherits the programmability and scalability of the Ising-type interactions with trapped ions that have been explored in numerous quantum simulation experiments. Our approach extends the capabilities of existing trapped ion quantum simulators to access a large class of spin Hamiltonians relevant for exploring exotic quantum phases such as superfluidity and spin liquids.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microgram BaCl_2 Ablation Targets for Trapped Ion Experiments</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-greenberg-microgram-ablation-paper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-greenberg-microgram-ablation-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Trapped ions for quantum information processing has been an area of intense study due to the extraordinarily high
fidelity operations that have been reported experimentally. Specifically, barium trapped ions have been shown to have
exceptional state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) fidelities. The 133Ba+ (I=1/2) isotope in particular is a promising candidate
for large-scale quantum computing experiments. However, a major pitfall with this isotope is that it is radioactive and
is thus generally used in microgram quantities to satisfy safety regulations. We describe a new method for creating microgram
barium chloride (BaCl_2) ablation targets for use in trapped ion experiments and compare our procedure to previous methods. We outline
two recipes for fabrication of ablation targets that increase the production of neutral atoms for isotope-selective loading of barium ions.
We show that heat-treatment of the ablation targets greatly increases the consistency at which neutral atoms can be produced
and we characterize the uniformity of these targets using trap-independent techniques such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
and neutral fluorescence collection. Our comparison between fabrication techniques and demonstration of consistent neutral fluorescence
paves a path towards reliable loading of 133Ba+ in surface traps and opens opportunities for scalable quantum computing with this isotope.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Investigations of 2D ion crystals in a hybrid optical cavity trap for quantum information processing</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sun-2d-ions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sun-2d-ions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; We numerically investigate a hybrid trapping architecture for 2D ion crystals using static electrode voltages and
optical cavity fields for in-plane and out-of-plane confinements, respectively. By studying the stability of 2D crystals against
2D-3D structural phase transitions, we identify the necessary trapping parameters for ytterbium ions. Multiple equilibrium
configurations for 2D crystals are possible, and we analyze their stability by estimating potential barriers between them.
We find that scattering to anti-trapping states limits the trapping lifetime, which is consistent with recent experiments employing
other optical trapping architectures. These 2D ion crystals offer an excellent platform for quantum simulation of frustrated spin systems,
benefiting from their 2D triangular lattice structure and phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions. Quantum information processing with tens
of ions is feasible in this scheme with current technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Optimization of the Optical Infrastructure and Trapping Potential for a Quantum Processor Based on Trapped Barium Ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-xinghe-tan-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2024-xinghe-tan-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ion quantum computers represent a cutting-edge quantum computing platform, keeping the highest reported state preparation and measurement fidelity of 99.97%. Recently, barium ion has emerged as the research interest of several teams due to its exceptional characteristics, including visible and inferred state transition frequencies, long-lived metastable states, and a simple hyperfine structure. Our research group aims to demonstrate trapping 16 133Ba+ ions on a micro-fabricated surface trap and build a quantum computing platform. In the long run, we intend to open access to this platform for the academic community to use. This project is named the QuantumIon project. The project started in 2019, just before the global pandemic. During the pandemic, the QuantumION team did not have the lab space and the components to prototype and benchmark subsystems in parallel with system design. Instead, the team designed the entire system on computers during the pandemic. I joined the QuantumION team in 2022 and performed the system assembly, validation and optimization when the pandemic restrictions were lifted. In this thesis, I describe the optimization of the optical system for delivering laser beams to the ions and the validation of a 0.6 NA imaging system that will be used to observe the ion fluorescence as a means of measuring its quantum state. While benchmarking the optical systems, I found that the performance of the components deviated from their ideal specifications, such as insertion loss. Therefore, I had to modify the system design to ensure the optical systems functioned in practice. In addition, I conducted a feasibility study on delivering an ablation laser via multimode fiber and simulated a trapping potential on the surface trap that achieved approximately even spacing for 12 out of the 16 trapped ions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Towards Pulsed Telecom Laser Ablation Loading for an Ytterbium Ion Trap</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-monica-zhu-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-monica-zhu-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ion system is a promising platform for quantum computing, with long qubit coherence, high gate and measurement fidelities. To harness the full potential of the trapped ion system, it is imperative to employ an efficient ion loading scheme. While the conventional oven loading method has its drawbacks, such as slow loading time, resource wastage, and potential contamination that can compromise system longevity and introduce decoherence, the pulsed laser ablation loading offers a promising alternative. This method enables fast, resource efficient, and controllable generation of a neutral atomic flux. This thesis explores the development of a 1.57 μm pulsed laser ablation (PLA) loading scheme for an Ytterbium ion trap. With endeavors in theoretical simulations and experimental setups designed with a keen emphasis on laser-induced damage thresholds, we successfully generated a neutral flux from the ablation laser, acquired a comprehensive isotope spectrum, and estimated the velocity distribution in the atomic plume. A fiber-coupled ablation delivery module was also designed and proved feasible along with the main ablation experiments. This study establishes a solid groundwork for the future integration of pulsed laser ablation loading into our trap system and provides invaluable empirical insights into the use of high-power infrared (IR) pulsed lasers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Programmable Individual Addressing and Floquet Hamiltonian Dynamics in a Trapped Ion Quantum Processor</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-chung-you-shih-phd-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ions have been gaining traction as a platform for quantum information processing (QIP) in both academia and industry over the last decade.

However, to unlock the full potential of the trapped ion platform, sophisticated quantum controls are required. In this thesis, we present our efforts in individual optical addressing to control an ion&amp;rsquo;s quantum state at an individual level, as well as efforts in generating complex and time-dependent Hamiltonians through arbitrary radio frequency (RF) waveform generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Developing a Large-Scale, Programmable Trapped Ion Quantum Simulator with In Situ Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sainath-motlakunta-phd-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-sainath-motlakunta-phd-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum simulators are a valuable resource for studying complex many-body systems. With their ability to provide near-term advantages, analog quantum simulators show great promise. In this thesis, my aim is to describe the construction of a large-scale trapped-ion based analog quantum simulator with several objectives in mind: controllability, minimal external decoherence, an expandable toolkit for quantum simulations, enhanced stability through robust design practices, and pushing the boundaries of error correction. One of the techniques that significantly expands the range of simulations possible in trapped ions is site-selective mid-circuit measurements and resets. This technique enables the exploration of new classes of quantum simulations, including measurement-based phase transitions and reservoir engineering with controlled dissipation. Additionally, mid-circuit measurements play a crucial role and serve as one of the key factors in achieving error-correction in trapped ions. In this thesis, I address the challenges associated with implementing mid-circuit measurements and discuss strategies for achieving state-of-the-art fidelities in these processes within our simulator. In this thesis, I present the results demonstrating the high-fidelity preservation of an &amp;ldquo;asset&amp;rdquo; ion qubit while simultaneously resetting or measuring a neighboring &amp;ldquo;process&amp;rdquo; qubit located a few microns away. The results show that we achieve a probability of accidental measurement of the asset qubit below 1×10⁻³ while resetting the process qubit. Similarly, when applying a detection beam on the same neighboring qubit to achieve fast detection times, the probability remains below 4×10⁻³ at a distance of 6 μm, which is four times the addressing Gaussian beam waist. These low probabilities correspond to the preservation of the quantum state of the asset qubit with fidelities above 99.9% for state reset and 99.6% for state measurement. One of the many fascinating aspects of physics that can be explored through the use of site-selective mid-circuit resets is reservoir engineering. In this thesis, I discuss a protocol utilizing reservoir engineering to efficiently cool the spin state of a subsystem that is coupled to a reservoir with controlled dissipation. I demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol through numerical simulations performed to optimize it for our experimental parameters. By leveraging the site-selective mid-circuit resets mentioned earlier, I successfully conduct a proof-of-principle dissipative many-body cooling experiment based on reservoir engineering. Through analog quantum simulation, I am able to demonstrate the lowering of energy within the system. In addition to the above explorations, another important aspect of this thesis is the description of the design, fabrication, and assembly of a large-scale trapped ion quantum simulator called the Blade trap. I discuss the essential features of this system that include accommodating a significant number of ions, extending ion lifetimes and coherence times, enabling precise control of ion spins and interactions, implementing efficient detection methods, and incorporating mid-circuit measurement capabilities. I also provide a detailed account of our approach to optimizing the design and fabrication of the blade-trap system, covering the trap itself, mechanical components, system internals, optics, and the critical ultra-high vacuum (UHV) assembly. Furthermore, comprehensive testing procedures are presented to evaluate the performance and stability of the Blade trap. I also describe the details about one of the significant challenges we faced in achieving and maintaining ultra-low pressure levels in the UHV system to ensure uninterrupted quantum simulation experiments with around 50 ions. High pressures can lead to detrimental collisions between ions and background atoms, necessitating re-trapping and introducing substantial overhead. Therefore, we aimed to achieve pressures in the range of 5×10⁻¹³ to 1×10⁻¹² mbar at room temperature, demanding meticulous optimization at the component level. Our journey to attain these pressures took approximately 2 to 3 years, complicated further by COVID-19 restrictions and equipment malfunctions. Despite the exhausting efforts, we successfully reached base pressures of less than 9×10⁻¹³ mbar in the vacuum chamber with partial internals. It is important to note that this measurement represents an upper limit due to gauge limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A guided light system for agile individual addressing of Ba+ qubits with 1E-4 level intensity crosstalk</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-binai-motlagh2023-a-guided-light-system/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2023-binai-motlagh2023-a-guided-light-system/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing, exhibiting the highest gate and measurement fidelities of all contending hardware. In order to realize a universal quantum computer with trapped ions, independent and parallel control over the state of each qubit is necessary. The manipulation of individual qubit states in an ion chain via stimulated Raman transitions generally requires light focused on individual ions. In this manuscript, we present a novel, guided-light individual addressing system for hyperfine Ba+ qubits. The system takes advantage of laser-written waveguide technology, enabled by the atomic structure of Ba+, allowing the use of visible light to drive Raman transitions. Such waveguides define the spatial mode of light, suppressing aberrations that would have otherwise accumulated in a free-space optics set up. As a result, we demonstrate a nearest neighbour relative intensity crosstalk on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;, without any active aberration compensation. This is comparable to or better than other previous demonstrations of individual addressing. At the same time, our modular approach provides independent and agile control over the amplitude, frequency, and phase of each channel; combining the strengths of previous implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ion Trap Long-Range XY Model for Quantum State Transfer and Optimal Spatial Search</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-lewis-bose-ion-trap-long-range-xy-model-for-quantum-state-transfer-and-optimal-spatial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-lewis-bose-ion-trap-long-range-xy-model-for-quantum-state-transfer-and-optimal-spatial/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Linear ion trap chains are a promising platform for quantum computation and simulation. The XY

scheme, giving interactions that decay as 1/r^α
, where α parameterises the interaction range. Lower
α leads to longer range interactions, allowing faster long-range gate operations for quantum computing. However, decreasing α causes an increased generation of coherent phonons and appears to
dephase the effective XY interaction model. We characterise and show how to correct for this effect
completely, allowing lower α interactions to be coherently implemented. Ion trap chains are thus

their significance due to the simplicity of fabrication while producing high-quality systems suitable for quantum information processing, atomic clocks etc. For low noise operations such as minimizing ‘excess micromotion’, needles
should be geometrically straight and aligned precisely with respect to each other. Self-terminated electrochemical etching, previously employed for fabricating ion trap needle electrodes employs a sensitive and time-consuming technique
resulting in a low success rate of usable electrodes. Here we demonstrate an etching technique for quick fabrication of
straight and symmetric needles with a high success rate and a simple apparatus with reduced sensitivity to alignment
imperfections. The novelty of our technique comes from using a two-step approach employing turbulent etching for
fast shaping and slow etching/polishing for subsequent surface finish and tip cleaning. Using this technique, needle
electrodes for an ion-trap can be fabricated within a day, significantly reducing the setup time for a new apparatus. The
needles fabricated via this technique have been used in our ion-trap to achieve trapping lifetimes of several months.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On the evaluation of quantum instruments with a consideration to measurements in trapped ion systems</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-darian-mclaren-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-darian-mclaren-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ion chains have shown promise in their application as quantum simulators.
However, the close proximity of ions in the trap leads to operations such as state detection
causing loss of coherence of other ions due to imperfect beam addressing and absorption
of scattered photons during neighbouring ion fluorescence. In the first part of my thesis I
consider a Ytterbium 171 ion trap and calculate the probability of neighbouring ion photon
absorption. I additionally show how to use the Lindblad master equation to simulate the
dynamics of an ion under an attenuated beam, and provide a review of determining the
detection fidelity through histograms of photon detection counts.
I then return to the more abstract setting of non-destructive quantum measurements,
which are instrumental for fault-tolerant quantum computers. These non-destructive quantum measurements have both a quantum and classical output and hence must be described
through a quantum instrument as opposed to the typical representation of measurements
through POVM’s. It therefore becomes necessary to develop methods for evaluating quantum instruments. In this thesis I show that the process fidelity and diamond distance as
figures of merits on unitary channels may be generalized to figures of merits on quantum
instruments. I show that these figures of merit adequately capture the errors associated to
non-destructive measurements, and they additionally provide upper and lower bounds for
each other. Several examples are also given of computing the figures of merit on quantum
instruments under various noise models.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Coherent interactions and thermometry in a trapped ion quantum simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-anthony-vogliano-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-anthony-vogliano-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Quantum simulators are useful tools to study exotic systems which may be otherwise
intractable for a traditional computer. In particular, the trapped-ion platform has been a
leading candidate for use in quantum simulation experiments because of its high fidelity
state-preparation and measurement operations and its all-to-all connectivity. The relative
difficulty of interacting with the long lived hyperfine states of 171Yb+
ions make them
excellent choices for encoding information as the isolation creates stability against a noisy
environment. Maintaining coherence for such a long time opens the door for complex
coherent interactions, which are a backbone of quantum simulation experiments. One of
the most critical coherent operations for a trapped-ion quantum simulator is the entangling
Molmer-Sørenson interaction.
Building up to the Molmer-Sørenson interaction requires fine control over not just the
state of the quantum register, but also the motional state of the ion. For this reason,
cooling to near the ground state of motion is crucial to obtaining high fidelity experiments.
Characterizing the temperature in such systems can prove challenging, requiring coherent
techniques.
In this thesis, I describe my work towards preparing a Molmer-Sørenson interaction
for a 171Yb+
trapped ion quantum simulator. I detail the methods used to bring-up the
coherent Raman interactions, and characterize the Doppler cooling and Continuous Sideband Cooling (CSBC) techniques we use, their implementations on our system, and their
limitations. I characterize the temperature of our ions before and after CSBC using coherent methods, showing a 46x improvement in the motional state population and confirming
that post-CSBC the ions are in the Lamb-Dicke regime. I also summarize my efforts in
constructing a future ”blade trap” system with enough precision in the alignment of the
electrodes to eventually enable efficient cooling. I show preliminary evidence that 5um
precision in blade position should be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Robust Optical Engineering for a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-ali-binai-motlagh-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2022-ali-binai-motlagh-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ions are one of the leading platforms for the implementation of quantum information processing (QIP),

now is to maintain these high quality operations while expanding the system size beyond the ∼10-30 qubits that
are available in today’s devices. Currently we are near completion of the construction of our trapped ion quantum
computer that will incorporate multiple isotopes of barium as qubits/qudits. Barium has several favourable properties
that make it the ideal ion for QIP and the aim of our device in the near future is to develop this species into
the premiere ion for QIP. The device in the future is hoped to serve as a cloud based resource for the Waterloo
research community, fostering collaborations between algorithms, error correction and atomic physics researchers,
that is ultimately hoped to expedite the development of trapped ion QIP. This thesis discusses the robust optical
engineering that went into the construction of this trapped ion quantum computer. We describe the details of the
continuous wave optical subsystems used for ion initialization, cooling, and measurements of the quantum states,
including the imaging system used to collect ion fluorescence. In addition, this thesis discusses the unique individual
addressing system that we have designed and built for performing single and two-qubit gates based on Raman transitions.
With this system we attain a relative intensity crosstalk between neighbouring ions on the order of 1e−4.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Technical noise present in laser systems can limit their ability to perform high fidelity quantum control of atomic qubits. The ultimate fidelity floor for atomic qubits driven with laser radiation is due to spontaneous emission from excited energy levels. The goal is to suppress the technical noise from the laser source to below the spontaneous emission floor such that it is no longer a limiting factor. It has been shown that the spectral structure of control noise can have a large influence on achievable control fidelities, while prior studies of laser noise contributions have been restricted to noise magnitudes. Here, we study the unique spectral structure of laser noise and introduce a new metric that determines when a stabilised laser source has been optimised for quantum control of atomic qubits. We find requirements on stabilisation bandwidths that can be orders of magnitude higher than those required to simply narrow the linewidth of a laser. We introduce a new metric, the χ-separation line, that provides a tool for the study and engineering of laser sources for quantum control of atomic qubits below the spontaneous emission floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simulating a measurement-induced phase transition for trapped ion circuits</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-czichek-mpt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-czichek-mpt/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this theoretical proposal, we describe a hybrid circuit where coherent time evolution is interrupted by sparse projective measurements. A measurement-driven phase transition between volume-law and area-law entanglement is predicted at a specific rate of measurement. Proof-of-principle experiments can be performed in modern trapped ion quantum information processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of programmable quantum devices has motivated the exploration of circuit models which could realize novel physics. A promising candidate is a class of hybrid circuits, where entangling
unitary dynamics compete with disentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different
entanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with universal properties
hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped ion hardware is a leading contender for the
experimental realization of such physics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling
gates, but a constant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the circuit. Recent
progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of individual ions makes preparing a
constant rate of measurements throughout a unitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations,
we show that the resulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a
volume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays universal hallmarks
of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations are able to characterize the critical
exponents using circuit sizes with tens of qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition
should be robust against additional sources of experimental noise expected in modern trapped
ion hardware, and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on post selection. Our work
highlights the powerful role that tensor network simulations can play in advancing the theoretical
and experimental frontiers of critical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Optical Design for an Open Access Trapped Ion Quantum Processor</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-videnov-msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-videnov-msc-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The future of quantum information is scaling to a ever larger number of qubits.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; We present a new quantum programming language
called ‘Quala’ that enables true full-stack programming of quantum
hardware. Quala allows seamless integration of abstraction
layers such as the digital circuit layer and the analog control pulse
waveform layer. Additionally, the language supports user-issued
low-level hardware instructions like FPGA actions. Mid-circuit
measurements and branching decision logic support real-time,
adaptive programs. This flexibility allows users to write code for
everything from quantum error correction to analog quantum
simulation. The combination of a user-facing calibration database
and a powerful symbolic algebra framework provides users with
an unprecedented level of expressiveness and transparency. We
display the salient characteristics of the language structure and
describe how the accompanying compiler can translate programs
written in any abstraction layer into precisely timed hardware
commands. We intend for this language to bridge the gap
between circuit-level programming and physical operations on
real hardware while maintaining full transparency in each level
of the stack. This eliminates the need for “behind-the-scenes”
compilation and provides users with insights into the day-to-day
calibration routines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reprogrammable and high-precision holographic optical addressing of trapped ions for scalable quantum control</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-shih-dmd-paper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2021-shih-dmd-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate programmable, holographic optical addressing of trapped Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at &lt;em&gt;λ&lt;/em&gt;=369 nm.

We elaborate the fabrication of the trapping electrodes using electro-etching techniques and explore the underlying mechanism in details. We discuss how these electrodes are powered by DC and RF field to generate the confining potential responsible for trapping the ions of interest in 3D. We conclude by studying how this trapping potential can be modified by external means like using an optical tweezer. Employing such an optical tweezer we propose a new quantum-thermodynamic protocol which shall allow us to experimentally access the thermal properties of a mixed specie ion chain using a single-specie ion chain. The scheme is based on Jarzynski&amp;rsquo;s equality and obviates the need to trap dual-ionic species as far as illustrating the mechanical properties of the chain are concerned. We present results ratifying the utility of the proposal.

This work is a collaboration with Prof. Roger Melko&amp;rsquo;s group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Trapped ions have emerged as one of the highest quality platforms for the
quantum simulation of interacting spin models of interest to various fields of
physics. In such simulators, two effective spins can be made to interact with
arbitrary strengths by coupling to the collective vibrational or phonon states
of ions, controlled by precisely tuned laser beams. However, the task of
determining laser control parameters required for a given spin-spin interaction
graph is a type of inverse problem, which can be highly mathematically complex.
In this paper, we adapt a modern machine learning technique developed for
similar inverse problems to the task of finding the laser control parameters
for a number of interaction graphs. We demonstrate that typical graphs, forming
regular lattices of interest to physicists, can easily be produced for up to 50
ions using a single GPU workstation. The scaling of the machine learning method
suggests that this can be expanded to hundreds of ions with moderate additional
computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Holographic Optical Manipulation of Trapped Ions for Quantum Simulation</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-holographic-optical-manipulation-of-trapped-ions-for-quantum-simulation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-holographic-optical-manipulation-of-trapped-ions-for-quantum-simulation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trapped ion is one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation experiment due to its long coherence time and high fidelity state initialization, detection, and manipulation. To individually address ions at a single-ion level, it requires sophisticated optical engineering. In the thesis, we present a novel single qubit addressing system that is immune to imperfections of optical imaging and can scale to different size of the system. The technique is based on digital light processing with a commercially available digital micro-mirror device (DMD). A DMD is a 2D array that consists of tiny micro-mirrors that can be individually manipulated. It is commonly used in movie projectors to modulate the intensity of the light to create the desired image. However, using this technology to ions will require more sophisticated controls over optical wavefronts of the laser beams, for example, the necessity to manipulate the optical phase. It can be achieved by using the DMD as a programmable hologram, which can then be used to characterize and compensate for any imaging imperfections as well. We developed a new iterative Fourier transform algorithm (IFTA) for calculating the holograms. In the simulation, our algorithm shows more than one order of magnitude improvement in accuracy comparing to previously proposed algorithms. We experimentally demonstrated this holographic beam shaping technique with the optical aberration being compensated. The laser we used in the experiment is in the ultraviolet (UV) regime that is close to the optical transition used for manipulating $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$ qubits. The short wavelength makes it more susceptible to environmental disturbance. Also, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a new scheme that enables holographic controls over lights with multiple laser frequencies simultaneously by combing the DMD with an acousto-optical modulator (AOM). The AOM splits the light and illuminates different zones of the DMD. Each zone has its own hologram forming one frequency channel for addressing. This opens the possibility to engineer more complex Hamiltonian for quantum simulation. For example, we can engineer arbitrary spin-spin interaction graphs by applying the M\o lmer-S\o rensen scheme on this new setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Design and Construction of an Ion Trapping Apparatus for Quantum Simulation Experiments</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2019-design-and-construction-of-an-ion-trapping-apparatus-for-quantum-simulation-experiments/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The trapped ions platform represents an excellent framework for Quantum information science experiments.

The simulation protocol makes use of native long range interactions between trapped ion spins, that are then digitally modified to achieve the target spin-spin interaction graph. On one hand, the hybrid simulation scheme is more flexible and requires less experimental control over individual ions than an analog quantum simulation, where the Hamiltonian is simulated by fine-tuning the control parameters. On the other hand, the hybrid simulation scheme does not build the entire time evolution out of quantum logic gates, unlike a fully digital quantum simulator, and therefore is more robust against Trotterization errors.

the various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities. The
observed probabilities show that the multislip regime can be reached
dynamically at smaller corrugations than would be possible statically, and can
be described by an equilibrium Boltzmann model. While a clear microscopic

is often responsible for the complexity of many body systems, from social and
neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. In quantum magnetic systems,
frustration arises naturally from competing spin-spin interactions given by the
geometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic
couplings. Frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such
as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses and spin ices, whose ground states are
massively degenerate and can carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. The
controlled study of frustrated magnetism in materials is hampered by short
dynamical time scales and the presence of impurities, while numerical modeling
is generally intractable when dealing with dynamics beyond N~30 particles.
Alternatively, a quantum simulator can be exploited to directly engineer
prescribed frustrated interactions between controlled quantum systems, and
several small-scale experiments have moved in this direction. In this article,
we perform a quantum simulation of a long-range antiferromagnetic quantum Ising
model with a transverse field, on a crystal of up to N = 16 trapped Yb+ atoms.
We directly control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range
of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their
dynamics through spatially-resolved spin detection. We find a pronounced
dependence of the magnetic order on the amount of frustration, and extract
signatures of quantum coherence in the resulting phases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quantum simulation of spin models on an arbitrary lattice with trapped ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-korenblit-quantum-simulation-of-spin-models-on-an-arbitrary-lattice-with-trapped-ions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-korenblit-quantum-simulation-of-spin-models-on-an-arbitrary-lattice-with-trapped-ions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of trapped atomic ions represents one of the most attractive platforms for the quantum simulation of interacting spin networks and quantum magnetism.

This scheme uses currently available trap technology and is scalable to levels where the classical methods of simulation are intractable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quantum Simulation of Interacting Spin Models With Trapped Ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-quantum-simulation-of-interacting-spin-models-with-trapped-ions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2012-quantum-simulation-of-interacting-spin-models-with-trapped-ions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Onset of a quantum phase transition with a trapped ion quantum simulator</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2011-onset-of-a-quantum-phase-transition-with-a-trapped-ion-quantum-simulator/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2011-onset-of-a-quantum-phase-transition-with-a-trapped-ion-quantum-simulator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A quantum simulator is a well controlled quantum system that can simulate the
behavior of another quantum system which may require exponentially large
classical computing resources to understand otherwise. In the 1980s, Feynman
proposed the use of quantum logic gates on a standard controllable quantum
system to efficiently simulate the behavior of a model Hamiltonian. Recent
experiments using trapped ions and neutral atoms have realized quantum
simulation of Ising model in presence of external magnetic fields, and showed
almost arbitrary control in generating non-trivial Ising coupling patterns.
Here we use laser-cooled trapped 171-Yb+ ions to simulate the emergence of
magnetism in a system of interacting spins by implementing a fully-connected
non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. To link
this quantum simulation to condensed matter physics, we measure scalable
correlation functions and order parameters appropriate for the description of
larger systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. By increasing the
Ising coupling strengths compared with the external field, the crossover from
paramagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up from N
= 2 to 9 trapped ion spins. This points toward the onset of a quantum phase
transition that should become infinitely sharp as the system approaches the
macroscopic scale. We compare the measured ground state order to theory, which
may become intractable for non-uniform Ising couplings as the number of spins
grows beyond 20- 30 and even NP complete for a fully-connected frustrated Ising
model, making this experiment an important benchmark for large-scale quantum
simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quantum simulation and phase diagram of the transverse-field Ising model with three atomic spins</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2010-edwards-quantum-simulation-and-phase-diagram-of-the-transverse-field-ising-model-with-three-atomic-spins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2010-edwards-quantum-simulation-and-phase-diagram-of-the-transverse-field-ising-model-with-three-atomic-spins/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We perform a quantum simulation of the Ising model with a transverse field using a collection of three trapped atomic ion spins. By adiabatically manipulating the Hamiltonian, we directly probe the ground state for a wide range of fields and form of the Ising couplings, leading to a phase diagram of magnetic order in this microscopic system. The technique is scalable to much larger numbers of trapped ion spins, where phase transitions approaching the thermodynamic limit can be studied in cases where theory becomes intractable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins with trapped ions</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2010-quantum-simulation-of-frustrated-ising-spins-with-trapped-ions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2010-quantum-simulation-of-frustrated-ising-spins-with-trapped-ions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Laser-cooled and trapped atomic ions form an ideal standard for the
simulation of interacting quantum spin models. Effective spins are represented
by appropriate internal energy levels within each ion, and the spins can be
measured with near-perfect efficiency using state-dependent fluorescence
techniques. By applying optical fields that exert optical dipole forces on the
ions, their Coulomb interaction can be modulated in ways that give rise to
long-range and tunable spin-spin interactions that can be reconfigured by
shaping the spectrum and pattern of the laser fields. Here we review the
theoretical mapping of atomic ions to interacting spin systems, the
experimental preparation of complex equilibrium states, and the study of
dynamical processes of this many-body interacting quantum system. The use of
such quantum simulators for studying spin models may inform our understanding
of exotic quantum materials and shed light on interacting quantum systems that
cannot be modeled with conventional computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Entanglement and Tunable Spin-Spin Couplings between Trapped Ions Using Multiple Transverse Modes</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-entanglement-and-tunable-spin-spin-couplings-between-trapped-ions-using-multiple-transverse-modes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate tunable spin-spin couplings between trapped atomic ions,
mediated by laser forces on multiple transverse collective modes of motion. A
$\sigma_x \sigma_x$-type Ising interaction is realized between quantum bits
stored in the ground hyperfine clock states of Yb ions. We demonstrate
entangling gates and tailor the spin-spin couplings with two and three trapped
ions. The use of closely-spaced transverse modes provides a new class of
interactions relevant to quantum computing and simulation with large
collections of ions in a single crystal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Large-scale quantum computation in an anharmonic linear ion trap</title><link>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-large-scale-quantum-computation-in-an-anharmonic-linear-ion-trap/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://qiti.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/publications/2009-large-scale-quantum-computation-in-an-anharmonic-linear-ion-trap/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We propose a large-scale quantum computer architecture by stabilizing a

under the Doppler temperature based on coupling to a near-continuum of
