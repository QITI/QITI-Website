21 Jan 2020 – “Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator” is published in Quantum Science and Technology 5 (2020) 024001, (arXiv.1910.02496). We numerically demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently solve a non-linear inversion problem in an analog trapped-ion quantum simulator. The method generates experimental control parameters (such as laser intensities on each ions) needed to program a quantum simulator, in particular, to engineer an arbitrary spin lattice geometry in one, two, and three dimensions using a linear chain of ions! 

17 Dec 2019 –  Here is a pre-print version of a review article on quantum simulation with trapped ions. The article focuses on analog spin simulation, and discusses the progress in this field so far. (arxiv.1912.07845).

08 Oct 2019 –  Our manuscript “Machine learning design of a trapped-ion quantum spin simulator” is on arXiv.1910.02496. We demonstrate that a machine learning neural network can be used to efficiently engineer an arbitrary spin-spin interaction graph on an analog quantum simulator.
